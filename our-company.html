              <strong>Little of History</strong>
              We, group of friends, mountaineers, people of different
              professions, but united by love to mountains, in late 80’s decided
              to create organization to promote mountaineering and apply it to
              practical, even commercial projects…. and Georgian Guide Service
              (GGS) was born. Organizing expeditions, taking part in rescue
              operations, exchanging visits with mountaineers from other
              countries was main activity of GGS. Later little metamorphose
              brought name extension - Georgian Guide Service - Caucasian
              Travel, as sign of intention starting travel business, even not
              much was happening, in terms of tourism. However, in 1991 we
              decided to be more tourism dedicated and encouraged with an idea
              to promote our beloved country Georgia, its Culture, Nature,
              History, Traditions, People to just opening world. It was the time
              when Soviet Union was “passing away” and Country was making first
              independent steps. Introducing Georgia and Caucasus to the world
              became main mission of Company, fully dedicated to safety, quality
              services, sincere hospitality, creativity and rock-solid
              reliability. We keep same commitment and enthusiasm for 30 years,
              welcoming many thousand visitors from all over the world to give
              them unforgettable experience framed in excellent services.
