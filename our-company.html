                <strong>Little of History</strong>
                We, group of friends, mountaineers, people of different
                professions, but united by love to mountains, in late 80’s
                decided to create organization to promote mountaineering and
                apply it to practical, even commercial projects…. and Georgian
                Guide Service (GGS) was born. Organizing expeditions, taking
                part in rescue operations, exchanging visits with mountaineers
                from other countries was main activity of GGS. Later little
                metamorphose brought name extension - Georgian Guide Service -
                Caucasian Travel, as sign of intention starting travel business,
                even not much was happening, in terms of tourism. However, in
                1991 we decided to be more tourism dedicated and encouraged with
                an idea to promote our beloved country Georgia, its Culture,
                Nature, History, Traditions, People to just opening world. It
                was the time when Soviet Union was “passing away” and Country
                was making first independent steps. Introducing Georgia and
                Caucasus to the world became main mission of Company, fully
                dedicated to safety, quality services, sincere hospitality,
                creativity and rock-solid reliability. We keep same commitment
                and enthusiasm for 30 years, welcoming many thousand visitors
                from all over the world to give them unforgettable experience
                framed in excellent services.

                Back in 1991, Caucasus Travel was pioneer and at the same time
                the only company focused on incoming tourism of newly
                independent country of Georgia, as well as of whole south
                Caucasus region as new and attractive tourist destination. Over
                the 30 years we irreplaceably bespoken are The First Choice Tour
                Operator, never compromised quality, creativity, safety and
                value of our product/services. We are the company of choice for

                <strong>Professional Staff with "Field Experience"</strong>
                Company Managers and staff have had special training in tourism
                management in various leading institutions of Europe, USA and
                Japan. Caucasus Travel employs and contracts people with diverse
                professional backgrounds. This enables us competently and
                successfully plan, design and carry various tours in many fields
                of interest: archaeology, history, culture, art, ethnology,
                mountaineering, trekking .... So, our programs are not templates
                taken from somewhere, but became samples of "how to do" for many
                newcomers and competitors. Caucasus Travel office team counts
                over 30 people taking care of whole operations, product
                development, planning, finances, marketing strategy, sales, tour
                operations, etc. Permanent training office staff keeps them

              <p>
                We are employing over 100 periodical workers, such as guides,
                assistants, drivers, service staff, etc. They are best
                professionals in their fields: well experienced, trained and
                motivated. Most of them are working solely with us, some are
                freelancers. It is great and big team, however surely, we always
                have operational backup team on standby. It is unlikely, but in
                case of extra or emergency need, whether in the field or the
                cities, the backup teams are ready immediately provide needed
                services or support and solve any problem, if such arise.

                <strong>Liabilities & Insurance </strong>
                There was quite a long period, when Professional Liability or
                even any insurance was available in Georgia, like in many other
                emerging countries. However, we were lucky (probably not only)
                to went trough of those years without cases to be covered by not
                existing liability Insurance. Of course, during the 30 years we
                had cases when doe to nature’s caprice, roads were closed,
                groups were stacked in high mountains, emergency transportation
                of injured climber was needed, customers insurance was not
                covering cases, other circumstances of events not depending on
                us. Even in such cases, we can proudly admit that we never left
                our guests, partners, in trouble. We always found a way to solve
                the problem, sharing burden and not leaving it on partners or
                guests shoulders alone. Nowadays, thanks to market and insurance
                business development, quite some insurance options are
                available, and we are having the best. Caucasus Travel is
                insured by Liability (professional) Insurance with aggregate
                limit of 1 Million USD. This is maximum range required by our
                partners currently, however its not limit if needed.
