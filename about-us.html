              <h2>UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for Tourism</h2>

              <p>
                On April 4th, 2017 Caucasus Travel signed the document of
                Private Sector Commitment to the UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for
                Tourism. Caucasus Travel is among five hundred sixty private
                enterprises Worldwide, that joined the Global Code of Ethics and
                Corporate responsibility. We were honoured to receive that
                document from hands of Mr. Taleb Rifai, Secretary General of
                UNWTO.
              </p>

              <p>
                Actually, we committed to that criteria, by heart, much earlier,
                from very first steps of our Company
              </p>

              <p>
                At the times, when Caucasus Travel was established, Georgia
                entered one of the most turbulent times of its history. As a
                result of ethnic conflicts and Russian occupation, collapse of
                economy, ethnic cleansing and hundreds of thousands of
                Internally Displaced Persons and many other unfortunate
                developments, Georgia’s tourism infrastructure was entirely
                destroyed. Caucasus Travel found itself not only a pioneer of
                post-Intourist tourism world, but also developer of human
                capital and capacity builder of rural and remote area
                communities. Company rushed in to discovering and bringing on
                board motivated, hard-working people - home and vehicle owners
                in Tbilisi and regions, now job-less scientists, academics,
                professors, teachers, young villagers, farmers, etc, creating
                its own supply circle, which, apparently became foundation for
                incoming tourism in Georgia. There was no Corporate Social
                Responsibility meaning at that times – certainly not in the
                country with just very few emerging private businesses, however,
                we are proud of our deeds.
