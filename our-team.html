        <p>
          I am working at Caucasus Travel since 1997 and remember, how at next
          day of interview, jumped to van with other few members of company for
          familiarization/revision trip around Georgia. After University years
          and few months of office manager position in a Bank, it was true
          Adventure. Its easy to fall in love with tourism, so since that I
          worked as a Guide, Assistant, Reservationist, Tour Operator, Sales &
          Marketing and Administrative Manager and today I am very glad to
          represent Caucasus Travel and its great team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are over 30 people in the office, and more than100 people in field
          service teams, such as Guides, Assistants, Drivers, Service mans, etc.
          Those in fields are Company faces for our guests and perform final and
          most important part of our business – provision of services, when
          those in office are managing whole operations of company, planning,
          finance, marketing, sales, tour operations, services, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both, office and field staff are united under one task and criteria –
          be perfect host to our guests, providing best services, giving them
          moments of unforgettable experiences and genuine hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caucasus Travel managers speak two-three foreign languages. Apart of
          English, dedicated officers and staff are speaking Japanese, German,
          French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.
        </p>

          Product & Sales Managers are most important officers of Company. In
          charge of Product Creation and Development, Designing, Sales,
          Communication with partners, Supervising operations, they are chiefs
          of their markets and operations. They coordinate efforts with each
          other and of course with company management. Their departments, formed
          by tour operators and project managers are small centres of expertise
          and perfect soil for career growth for newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supply and Service team members are hidden heroes of our battle for
          providing best product to our guests, to meet and overwhelm their
          expectations. Managers and other staff of this unit have very tense
          and responsible missions, which they are performing on highest
          standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Administrative and Financial team keeps doing their routine, but
          extremely important role in success of our company. Dealing with
          hundreds of contractors, suppliers, employees, defending our interest
          and same time keeping our reputation of good partner, employer and
          taxpayer is extremely important job and they perform it perfectly.
